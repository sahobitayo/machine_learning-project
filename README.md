# The Next One

## Background
Machine Learning Technology Field has been rapidly developed in the last decade.  In this project, we took Machine Learning to predict upcomign erthquake s from previous data. CNN was chosen for its proven accurate predictions up to 98% with just a few layers of Conv2D and Dense Networks. Basically, Conv2D in this project works as a "scanner" to continously read and processed image pixels, highlight features of each digit in the 2D space intead of 1D as the Dense network, which is better and more common for analyzing visual imagery.
